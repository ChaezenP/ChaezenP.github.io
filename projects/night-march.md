summary: "In a program called Gameheads, my team developed a video game based on the stories and legends of the Hawaiian *Night Marchers*."
---

During each summer, Gameheads students create teams among themselves to create a game over the summer with a core idea shared by each team member. It was my first year and there were two more students from Hawaiʻi as first years too. We teamed up with some others from the continental U.S and we searched for a story or practice that can be shown to teach others about Hawaiian culture. We agreed on the stories of the Night Marchers. We decided that the core theme is respect, specifically respect toward our Hawaiian ancestors and aliʻi (chiefs). The core mechanic we came up with is to kneel in front of the Night Marchers until they pass to show respect towards them. 

For this project, we used Unity to develop this game. I was the background artist and co-cultural lead. I reached out to former kumu and uncles to share their stories and the cultural significance of the Night Marchers to Hawaiʻi. As the background artist, I used my own and my friends and familyʻs photos of hikes around the islands as a reference to create a forest scene. I included lehua and the yellow hibiscus in the foliage. Since the scene was set at night, I opted for cooler colors like blue and purple.
