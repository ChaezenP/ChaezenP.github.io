During the "spring semester", Gameheads students take classes that they choose. I chose to learn Blender and Unreal Engine 4. Utilizing the free assets in the Unreal store, I created a scene of a floating island with an ancient tower that has since been overgrown. The crystals have magical properties that allow the surrounding piece of land to float up into the air.
